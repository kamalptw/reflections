What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

using git init we initialize a repository
It turns up a message initialized empty git repository in followed by "folder path" + .git/
we need to initialize this in order to start keeping track of different versions of our project

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area lets you add files that you need to be tracked and upon which changes are to be committed in a repository version of git
working directory is all the files in a project that will be used to make the project i guess
