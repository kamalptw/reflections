reflections on asteroid

how did viewing diffreence between two versions help you?

it was helpful because...I understood the  differences very easily rather than searching line by line through the file. it was easy and i can imagine it being even more useful when there are more than 1000 lines of code
fc command for file comparison is useful 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I could easily go back to an old version and make changes in an easier way.
I could use this as a guide to know which method is more efficient and why

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

sometimes the commit could be too small to save as a new version. so you will have a history of commits that basically are hard to navigate thru.
but then again you can always switch to a smaller change very quickly rather than doing  a hour's work and enunciating every small details that you changed making the commit log bulky

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

sometimes two files are interrelated to each other so saving multiple files together makes sense.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log is used to maintain entire history of commits on files 
git diff is used to compare two commits by using their commit ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

knowing that i could always revert to a previous version gives me the freedom to code indifferently to major errors. So i am faster than the rest

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
My new projects on android,or other programming languages .
All my projects that i can upload using the github
