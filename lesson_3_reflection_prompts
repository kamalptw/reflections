When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to publicly host a project
When I have two or more contributors
When I want to save a backup online of my repository
When I want to put 'scene' and show off my skills

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because github commits can happen at different times and by different people, it is wiser to regulary pull changes manually from github.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks is used when u don't or rather not have permission to change someone else's repository but want to work on the current project and push it to your own forked repository

clones is when you want to save the project to your local system and if you want you also have the ability to push this to your own github repository

branches are used when you want to work on a sub task which is not yet ready for production environment. Like making and testing a new feature before production.
