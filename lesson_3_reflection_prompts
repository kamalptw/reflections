When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to publicly host a project
When I have two or more contributors
When I want to save a backup online of my repository
When I want to put 'scene' and show off my skills

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because github commits can happen at different times and by different people, it is wiser to regulary pull changes manually from github.
