When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to publicly host a project
When I have two or more contributors
When I want to save a backup online of my repository
When I want to put 'scene' and show off my skills

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because github commits can happen at different times and by different people, it is wiser to regulary pull changes manually from github.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks is used when u don't or rather not have permission to change someone else's repository but want to work on the current project and push it to your own forked repository

clones is when you want to save the project to your local system and if you want you also have the ability to push this to your own github repository

branches are used when you want to work on a sub task which is not yet ready for production environment. Like making and testing a new feature before production.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you have made one commit on local and someone else has made a commit on remote then when you do a git fetch it will show that you have diverged and there are one commits on both.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Collaboration would be harder
Managing different changes would be harder
reviewing changes before accepting via pull requests wud be harder

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you want to pull request you can push into github using
git push origin {branch name}
also working on other branch lets you make changes even break your own code without affecting other people's works
